# Predicting Food Prices in Developing Countries

## Overview
In this project, I took historical food price data from developing countries and used **time series analysis** in order to predict what the prices would be up to two years in the future. Throughout the project I dealt with strong **seasonality** in the dataset, explored both **regression** and **ARIMA** based models, and incorporated **climate data** in order to improve my results. My final model was able to achieve mean absolute percentage error scores of around 12 % on the test set, and was robust when cross-validated, but had difficulty predicting for extreme events.

## Buisness Case
Food insecurity is a massive global issue that affects over [345 million people worldwide in 2023](https://www.wfp.org/global-hunger-crisis), with more than 900,000 of those suffering in famine-like conditions. These problems can be especially acute in sub-saharan africa and the middle-east, where conflict disrupts the local food supply and climate change makes previously productive land more marginal. The ability to predict the local price of food months or years in advance would be of great value to international aid groups trying to alleviate this issue, and would allow them to better allocate resources to where they are needed most.
